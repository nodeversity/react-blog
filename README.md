This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose 
This is meant to be a proof-of-concept application using the new hook-based ReactJS app dev style and the Context API for state management.


## Tech Used:
* [ReactJS 16.9](https://reactjs.org)
* [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): For app routing
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): For  remote API calls


## Additional Resources:
* [JSONPlaceholder.typicode.com](https://JSONPlaceholder.typicode.com): For making CRUD calls against a faux (but functional) API server.
* 

## Running this App
* `npm start`: To start the development server
* `npm run build`: To create a production-ready 'build' ready for deployment. This will be in a new `build` directory adjacent to the dev workspace.
